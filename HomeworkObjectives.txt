1) You must have a login page -- no password, just nickname

2) If nickname is taken, system will rename it.

3) Once you are logged in, you should have the following windows

3.a) Channels (you will have different tabs) including a system log that gives information about user's connection.

3.b) Input box for messages

3.c) List with users connected

4) You will need to have tabs for the channels



5) You will have 3 types of users . SysOp (*) , Moderator (+), User



   SysOp can demote or promote. Moderator may promote others to moderator but not demote

6) The user may send messages to individual users (and it will appear as a private channel window) or to the channel
7) A SysOp may send messages to any channel or all channels... those messages (broadcast) should be in a different color and with *** *** in between (as well as italicized).
8) You have two type of channels.
#NameOfChannel : Channels created by a SysOp or Moderator.
##NameOfChannel: Channels created by a user
8.1) Channels created by SysOp or Moderators are permanent. SysOp may delete channels.
9) You will have to command for the following actions
/list (display channel list)
/list xxx (display channel that contains that string xxx)
/msg nick "mesage this" (sends private message to user). Once they are in the chat window, the chat windows takes care of the private messages (using the same emit command)
/nick mynewnick (changes nickname)
/quit
/join channel (joins channel and opens new window)
/leave channel (leaves channel and closes window)
/createChannel
/removeChannel
/promote nick
/demote nick
10) Program SysBot. each channel has one and the system has a main sysbot. Users can communicate with SysBot.
The basic SysBot replies to messages. For example,

/msg SysBot "Hello"
SysBot says
Hello Nick5 - We are in Channel X

/msg SysBot Help

list commands

10.1) create a special sysbot called SmartBot that works in any channel
You can do the following

/msg SmartBot calc  5*5*10+10/2*(1%2)

SmartBot returns value

10.2) Note that the smartbot, sysbot, and sysops are reserved nicks. So you can use it like this
SmartBot calc 2+2

11) You will need a special page that only an admin can access such as
chat/admin

with a username and password (ok to hardcode for homework).

In here you will see server messages of users coming in and out and all actions (except messages).
For example, user created channel

12) Create documentation.

Extra Credit

* User may registered their nickname to keep it permanent. In that case, they will need to add a password and that should be encrypted
* SmartBot rpn : Implement reverse polish notation.
